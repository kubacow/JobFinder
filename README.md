## JobFinder

JobFinder was my 5th semester project for a subject called Technologies of the Internet, which involved creating a CRUD web application using Node.js. During the development process, JobFinder was hosted locally using Docker (docker-compose), as well as PHP MyAdmin.

DISCLOSURE: The project was heavily influenced by classes taken during the course, thus majority of the structure and technologies used were implemented thanks to the aid of my professors. However, JobFinder remains an original project, developed by me.
